## Overview
### Description
The application allows users to plan their meals for the next week, and check the meals they have planned for the day.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Delivery/Food
- **Mobile:** The app is suited for mobile use since it gives users easy access to order/deliver food while on the go
- **Story:** Delivery apps are expensive. Delivery people have to go out of their way to go to a resturant, pick up food, and deliver it to a different location. There is wasted opportunity with students on a college campus. Students are able to deliver to one another with less hassle, as they are more likely to share usual locations.
- **Market:** This app would be targeted towards college students looking for cheaper delivery and also students looking to make extra money without much effort.
- **Habit:** Students looking to deliver would open the app whenever they are at a resturant. They would input where they are headed after leaving the resturant, and indicate they are open to picking up food. Students looking to order, can either open their app or be notified when a student is willing to deliver to their location. If a deliverer and an orderer are matched, they can communicate through temporary chat.
- **Scope:** The core features of this application is being able to match two students for food delivery. The basic version would allow students to input locations and able-to-deliver status. It wwill also allow the students to communicate through chat. Once the core features are implemented, the app will be extended to make the matching process more fluid and require less user input and chat.
